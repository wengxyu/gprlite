# Flask rules

- Use Blueprints to organize routes by feature or resource
- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for database models and ORM
- Use application factories for flexible application initialization
- Use Flask extensions for common functionality (Flask-Login, Flask-WTF, etc.)
- Store configuration in environment variables
- Use Flask-Migrate for database migrations
- Implement proper error handling with error handlers
- Use Flask-RESTful or similar for building APIs
